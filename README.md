## Title:
SUBSTRA: Supervised Bayesian Patient Stratification

## Abstract:
Patient stratification methods are key to the vision of precision medicine. Here, we consider transcriptional data to segment the patient population into subsets relevant to a given phenotype. Whereas most existing patient stratification methods focus either on predictive performance or interpretable features, we developed a method striking a balance between these two important goals. We introduce a Bayesian method called SUBSTRA that uses regularized biclustering to identify patient subgroups and interpretable subgroup-specific transcript clusters. The method iteratively re-weights feature importance to optimize phenotype prediction performance by producing more phenotype-relevant patient subgroups. We investigate the performance of SUBSTRA in finding relevant features using simulated data, and successfully benchmark it against state-of-the-art unsupervised stratification methods. Moreover, SUBSTRA achieves predictive performance competitive to the supervised benchmark methods and provides interpretable transcriptional features in diverse biological settings, such as drug response prediction, cancer diagnosis, or kidney transplant rejection.
